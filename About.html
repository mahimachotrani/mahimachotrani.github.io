<strong>ABOUT US:</strong> <br>
<br>
We're a US chocolatier with a rich history.<br>
<br>
Our originator, Johnny Harding, began moving custom made chocolates in downtown Seattle, US, in 1943. After 100+ long stretches of making fine chocolates, you become acquainted with some
things about doing it right.<br>
<br>
At Paradise Chocolates, everybody—from our chocolatiers to our in-shop chocolate epicureans—is constantly enlivened to remove you from the customary. We source premium-quality 
fixings from around the globe and pick nearby alternatives at whatever point conceivable. We never trade off on quality, and you wager you can taste it.<br>
<br>
All that we make at Paradise Chocolates is created with 100% feasible cocoa. We pay a premium for cocoa to guarantee our rancher accomplices and communities are upheld by projects that 
enhance their benefit and their families' occupations. It's an extremely basic decision we've settled on because it's the correct decision to make.<br>
<br>
Paradise Chocolates is a family-possessed organization that is gladly about chocolate.<br>
