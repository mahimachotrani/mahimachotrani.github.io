<strong> 1.Where did chocolate originate? </strong>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
The history of chocolate began in Mesoamerica. Fermented beverages made from chocolate date back to 450 BC. The Aztecs believed that cacao seeds were the gift of Quetzalcoatl, the god 
of wisdom, and the seeds once had so much value that they were used as a form of currency. Originally prepared only as a drink, chocolate was served as a bitter liquid, mixed with spices 
or corn puree. It was believed to be an aphrodisiac and to give the drinker strength. Today, such drinks are also known as "Chilate" and are made by locals in the South of Mexico. After 
its arrival to Europe in the sixteenth century, sugar was added to it and it became popular throughout society, first among the ruling classes and then among the common people. In the 20th
century, chocolate was considered essential in the rations of United States soldiers during war.

<strong> 4.My chocolate sometimes turns tan or white. What causes this? </strong>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Chocolate contains cocoa butter, a vegetable fat that is sensitive to heat and humidity. Temperatures above 75°F will cause chocolate to melt. The cocoa butter can rise to the surface and 
form a discoloration called "cocoa butter bloom." Condensation on milk or semi-sweet chocolate may cause the sugar to dissolve and rise to the surface as "sugar bloom." Chocolate that has 
"bloomed" is certainly safe to use, but flavor loss and texture changes may be noticed.

<strong> 5.How long should I keep chocolate? </strong>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Most confectionery products are at their best flavor for one year after manufacture. Ingredients such as nuts will shorten the shelf life. Products kept beyond recommended "best before" 
date may have flavor loss or texture changes. Keep in mind, however, that storage conditions greatly affect the quality of our products.
